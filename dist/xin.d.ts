/**
 * THE ACCESSOR SURFACE, AS DATA. This list is what the `get` trap actually
 * serves — it is the implementation's own answer to "what is the accessor
 * API", and therefore the only authoritative one.
 *
 * It is `as const` so the TYPES can be checked against it rather than
 * hand-restating it. Six declaration surfaces describe this one proxy
 * (`TosiAccessor`, `TosiProps`, `BoxedScalarAPI`, `BoxedArrayProps`,
 * `BoxedScalar`, `BoxedProxy`), nothing kept them in sync, and they drifted:
 * `tosiBinding` was present on two and missing from a third for an unknown
 * number of releases. `src/type-surface.test.ts` now fails if a name here is
 * absent from the declared accessor type.
