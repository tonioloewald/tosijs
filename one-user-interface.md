## The thesis, in five claims

Every app now has three kinds of user — **humans** (rendered DOM), **code**
(state), and **agents**, who today are forced to _impersonate humans_:
screenshot, guess, forge clicks. tosijs never needed the workaround:

- **State lives in one registry, addressed by paths** — `app.cart.items[id=123].qty`
  is a serializable, LLM-friendly _string_. No DOM required to name a thing.
- **Writes are legitimate from any entry point** — assign to a path and every
  bound widget updates, exactly as if the human had done it.
- **The DOM is persistent** — bindings wire real elements once; nothing is
  rebuilt out from under an observer, human or agent.
- **Observation is push, not poll** — `observe(path, …)` replaces screenshot
  diffing with notifications.
- Therefore: **an agent is just another observer with a different intelligence
  behind it.** We don't extend the architecture to serve AI — we _describe_ it.

**And the description is under oath.** The agent surface couldn't be a
separate package even if we wanted one — it reads the framework's own
records (the registry, the binding metadata, the handler wiring), so when
the map looks wrong, something _real_ is wrong: the renderer lied, or the
framework did. There is no adapter layer to absorb the discrepancy, which is
exactly what makes the map an instrument. One truth-test page found defects
in four different strata in a day — a harvest lying about accessible names,
a missing piece of the accessible-name algorithm, a **core binding bug**
that had shipped silently for two minor versions (fixed on npm within
hours of the map looking slightly off), and a coding pattern that needed
writing down. An integration absorbs discrepancies; an intrinsic surface
prosecutes them. The curb cut doesn't just serve the new users — _building
it audits the sidewalk._

## Proof: two users, one interface (live)

The human side is ordinary bound UI. The agent side never touches the DOM —
paths, actions, and push observation only. Add items from either side: both
stay in sync because **there is nothing to sync**, and the log shows the agent
being notified of your edits.

```js
import { elements, tosi, enableAgentInterface } from 'tosijs'

const { oneUI } = tosi({
  oneUI: {
    list: [{ id: 1, text: 'try the input →' }],
    addItem(text) {
      if (!text.trim()) return
      oneUI.list.push({ id: Math.random(), text })
    },
  },
})

// The PRODUCTION posture, not the dev one: this manifest names exactly what
// the agent side below touches. A bare enableAgentInterface() exposes NOTHING
// (1.9.0) — describe() would report an empty app and every verb would refuse,
// so the demo would not be a demo at all. (Also installs globalThis.tosiAgent.)
//
// Note what is NOT here: quoted paths. The proxies know where they live, so
// the manifest names the things themselves and survives a rename.
const agent = enableAgentInterface({
  expose: { roots: [oneUI], actions: [oneUI.addItem] },
})
const { div, h4, ul, input, button, pre } = elements

// THE HUMAN SIDE — an ordinary bound UI
preview.append(
  div(
    h4('Human (widgets)'),
    ul(
      { style: { maxHeight: '8em', overflow: 'auto', margin: 0 } },
      ...oneUI.list.listBinding(({ li }, item) => li(item.text), {
        idPath: 'id',
      })
    ),
    input({
      placeholder: 'add an item, hit Enter',
      onKeydown(event) {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
          oneUI.addItem(event.target.value)
          event.target.value = ''
        }
      },
    })
  )
)

// THE AGENT SIDE — no DOM access: paths, actions, observation only.
// The log is a direct preview child so it grows when the example is maximized.
const log = pre({
  style: { height: '100%', minHeight: '5em', overflow: 'auto', margin: 0 },
})
agent.observe(oneUI, (path) => log.append(`observed: ${path}\n`))
preview.append(
  div(
    h4('Agent (paths only)'),
    button('call(oneUI.addItem, …)', {
      onClick() {
        agent.call(oneUI.addItem, 'added by the agent')
      },
    }),
    ' ',
    button('read(oneUI.list)', {
      onClick() {
        log.append(JSON.stringify(agent.read(oneUI.list)) + '\n')
      },
    })
  ),
  log
)
```

````test
import { boxed } from 'tosijs'

// The page's own demo is the release's headline proof, and it was a plain
// ```js fence — so when the default posture was narrowed, this page kept
// calling call() on a surface that refuses it and NOTHING went red. This
// fence is the guard: it runs in Chromium and Firefox on every release.
//
// It drives THE DEMO'S OWN SURFACE, via the global the demo installed —
// deliberately, and it took two goes to get here. A ```test fence does not
// share SCOPE with the ```js fence above it (only the REGISTRY), so `oneUI`
// had to be reached through `boxed`. And enabling a second surface would
// disable the demo's: since 1.10.0 that revokes it, so the buttons you can
// click would refuse the moment this test ran. Testing the real surface is
// both safer and a better test.
test('the manifesto demo posture can actually do what the demo does', () => {
  const oneUI = boxed.oneUI
  const agent = globalThis.tosiAgent
  expect(agent.describe().exposure).toBe('manifest')
  const before = agent.read(oneUI.list).length
  agent.call(oneUI.addItem, 'from the test')
  expect(agent.read(oneUI.list).length).toBe(before + 1)
  // proxy and string name the same path — the demo above uses proxies, and
  // every published example that still quotes a path keeps working
  expect(agent.read('oneUI.list').length).toBe(before + 1)
  // …and the manifest is still a manifest: nothing outside it is reachable
  // (the doc-fence expect() is a small shim — no toThrow, so catch by hand)
  let refused = false
  try {
    agent.read('somethingElse')
  } catch (e) {
    refused = true
  }
  expect(refused).toBe(true)
})
````

**Open the console — you are the second user**: `tosiAgent.describe()`,
`tosiAgent.call('oneUI.addItem', 'from the console')`, `tosiAgent.changes()`.
An agentic browser gets the same deal: no extension, no vision, no selectors.

## The full argument, in five parts

This page is the thesis and its live proof. The detail lives in five child
documents:

1. **[The Derived Surface](/derived-surface/)** — the wiring diagram tosijs
   already records, the opportunistic harvest, and `describe()` assembling the
   whole page's affordance graph — live.
2. **[The Agent Surface](/agent-surface/)** — the launch toggle, the
   protocol-neutral surface, push-and-drain observation, and the exposure
   tiers — where the **schema-declared surface is the product** and the
   automatic map is the discovery tool. Plus ComponentMap.
3. **[Trust & Transports](/trust-and-transports/)** — the honest section: constraint
   bypass, capability scoping, secrets, prompt injection, audit — and the
   three distances an agent can stand at (in-page, bridged, remote peer).
4. **[Headless Embodiment](/headless-embodiment/)** — the inversion:
   "server-side rendering of an MCP" — the app running as its abstract self,
   vending UI on demand, with `elementsSSR` proven live.
5. **[Plan & Prior Art](/plan-and-prior-art/)** — phases 0–5, the open questions,
   and why the window is real (WebMCP is standardizing the transport slot
   _right now_; the core idea remains unclaimed).

---

_The observant model, stated for 2026: the framework watches state and updates
the UI. A human is an observer with eyes. An agent is an observer with a model.
Neither needs a special interface, because there is only one._
