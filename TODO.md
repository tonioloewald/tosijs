## work in progress

<!--{ "pin": "bottom" }-->

- change `MutationObserver` in Component if there's an `onDomChanged`
  or something handler to trigger it as appropriate
- automated golden tests?
- `css()` should handle multiple `@import`s
- possibly leverage component static property method (if we can keep type preservation)

- consider automatic observer cleanup via `FinalizationRegistry` — observers in the
  `listeners` array (path-listener.ts) persist forever unless explicitly `unobserve()`d
  or the callback returns `observerShouldBeRemoved`. If an observer is tied to a
  component/element, it could be auto-removed when the owner is GC'd (same pattern
  as `tosiUnique`'s owner-based cleanup).

## known issues

- bindList cloning doesn't duplicate svgs for some reason
