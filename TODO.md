# TODO

- happy-dom low-level tests
- browser based tests
- automated golden tests?
- can we change or add a way to import components that relies on xinjs types but doesn't load xinjs
  - buildComponent(tagName, factoryFunction) where you export factoryFunction
- `css` recognizes color instances and turns them into html (also maybe `toString` should alias `.html`)

# FIXME

- bindList cloning doesn't duplicate svgs for some reason
