## work in progress

<!--{ "pin": "bottom" }-->

- change `MutationObserver` in Component if there's an `onDomChanged`
  or something handler to trigger it as appropriate
- automated golden tests?
- `css()` should handle multiple `@import`s
- possibly leverage component static property method (if we can keep type preservation)

## known issues

- bindList cloning doesn't duplicate svgs for some reason
